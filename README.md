Task 3: Branching Strategy

The scenario states your team uses the GitFlow branching strategy. This strategy is a structured approach to managing your codebase.
Step-by-step instructions:
1.	Ensure you are on the d branch: The Git Flow model uses a main develop branch for all feature integration. Before you start, make sure your local repository is up-to-date with the remote develop branch.
	First, switch to the develop branch: git checkout master.
  Then, pull the latest changes from the remote: git pull origin master.
